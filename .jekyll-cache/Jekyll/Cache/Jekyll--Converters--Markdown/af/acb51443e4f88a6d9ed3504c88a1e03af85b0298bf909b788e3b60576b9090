<p>We agreed in the group to spend the entire today dedicated to a <strong>reproducibility hackathon</strong>.</p>

<p>This was intended as an occasion to cross-check each other‚Äôs models and code prior to publication. Everybody in the group is working on some code or model, to a different extent, so this was relevant for all - in principle.</p>

<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Bring your code or (LCA) model and prepare at least some basic documentation for the others to understand it.</li>
  <li>Write a few lines about what type of check you need and send them to the others latest the day before (you could have more than one need):
    <ul>
      <li><strong>code check</strong>: you need to have our model/code reviewed for readability, mistakes, structure, style (format, not content)</li>
      <li><strong>reproducibility check</strong>: you need to try if your model/code runs on another computer and produces the same results as on yours (e.g. for sharing as part of a publication)</li>
      <li><strong>solution check</strong>: you need help in finding a solution to a specific model/code problem or to understand if the model/code works correctly (content, not format)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt have code/model, and want to support others or learn, just bring yourself and computer</li>
  <li>Bring coffee/cake/candies/biscuits/fruit‚Ä¶long day ahead üòä</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="how-it-worked">How it worked</h1>

<p>We first made an <strong>overview</strong> of the needs and participants, and a schedule.</p>

<p>We then reviewed one code/model at the time. We had initially though about assigning different roles to everybody every time (some doing code-check others doing reproducibility-check) but in the end everybody did the same and the person ‚Äúin charge‚Äù for that turn was giving support and instructions and answering questions.</p>

<p>We worked based on the capacity and skills of the people present, which in terms of modelling and coding skills is very <strong>diverse</strong>, so that everybody was welcome and was contributing.</p>

<p>Mixed <strong>remote and physical</strong> participants (but at least a core group was present physically in a real room). This worked surprisingly well - I guess two years of COVID lockdowns have left their mark.</p>

<h1 id="outcome">Outcome</h1>

<p>We went <strong>overtime</strong>, this was anticipated, but not too much.</p>

<p>We had <strong>five review rounds</strong> in total, three reproducibility checks and two solution checks.</p>

<p>We compiled a shared document with the issues encountered in each round and with <strong>feedback</strong> to each code or model ‚Äúowner‚Äù so that they can improve the documentation, code or model after the hackathon</p>

<p>Examples of what we did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trying to a conda environment to work + importing databases + simulation.</li>
  <li>Finding a solution to a problem, e.g. modify a database and make a simulation.</li>
  <li>Trying some code we don‚Äôt understand written by others about stuff we don‚Äôt clearly understand. But that we need to use, and debugging.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I was exhausted after a full-day of coding/reviewing models but it was <strong>totally worth it</strong>. Everybody got something useful out of it I think.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: I had asked on twitter for suggestions and recommendations before the hackathon, and received a lot of good tips. You find them here:</p>
