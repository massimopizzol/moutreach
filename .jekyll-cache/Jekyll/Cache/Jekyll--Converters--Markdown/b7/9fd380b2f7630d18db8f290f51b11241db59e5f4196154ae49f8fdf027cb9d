<h1 id="readme-first">Readme first</h1>

<p>This is a post I wrote for an event at Aalborg University, a webinar of the AAUTREACH<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> series organised by <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/125497">Roman Jurowetzki</a> where he interviews/talks with different researchers at the university doing #scicomm. Somehow he found me and thought I was a good case. I am not sure I am but anyway‚Ä¶The stuff below is the outline of my presentation.</p>

<p>I am reading through this <em>LIVE</em>‚Ä¶</p>

<h1 id="meta-blogging">Meta-blogging</h1>

<p><em>Main reason for starting a blog?</em></p>

<p>Was to write things I don‚Äôt write in papers. Engage, have (more) fun. I talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matcashmore/">Matt (former colleague)</a> he had a blog. He said it was feasible and interesting, so I did it.</p>

<p><em>Jekyll, github, domain name, etc, WTF - sounds complicated. Why nerding out?</em></p>

<p>I did my homework and looked at different blogging platforms‚Ä¶wanted something simple and full control (no ads). I didn‚Äôt like Medium. I had somebody who helped (Emanuele, a friend). So I got my own domain, twenty bucks or so, and <a href="https://moutreach.science/2016/11/23/finally-online.html">set up the site</a> on Jekyll, this means that the site is on github, let‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/massimopizzol/moutreach">check it</a>.</p>

<p><em>Phylosophy?</em></p>

<p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> The result looks like <a href="https://envato.com/blog/90s-web-design-trends/">something from the 90es</a>‚Ä¶well, whatever. The typical <strong>structure</strong> is: title, excerpt, figure, text in sections. Some humour, have fun. The typical <strong>frequency</strong> is variable. I started with an idea of posting twice a month, then changed to once a month. Then too busy, or no good content (I want quality). Now occasionally. Typical <strong>content</strong>: stuff for students, stuff for the LCA community, update on research and outreach. See <a href="https://moutreach.science/tags/">tags</a>. A lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">meta</a> stuff: talking about doing the research rather than about the content of the research. There are better people than me being serious in blogs.</p>

<p><em>Why a comment-off policy?</em></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://fizzle.co/sparkline/debate-should-you-allow-comments-on-your-blog-find-out-what-two-remarkably-popular-bloggers-think">different opinions on this‚Ä¶</a> I investigated and read somewhere that there are three types of comments: ‚Äúvery good‚Äù, ‚Äúvery bad‚Äù, and the meaningfully constructive/critical. The latter are very very few, and this people write you anyway a mail - so why having comments?</p>

<p><em>Any troubles?</em></p>

<p>Not when you keep things nice, don‚Äôt insult anybody, are polite. You are basically writing on the internet with no moderation FFS this requires some higher ethical standards. <a href="https://moutreach.science/2020/11/10/LCA-anwering-the-right-questions.html">Ask people</a> before using their stuff or commenting on their work (haven‚Äôt done that once and got troubles, then fixed them but still, lesson learned‚Ä¶)</p>

<p><em>Who reads this?</em></p>

<p>No idea, no tracking. We are already being tracked on many things as researchers, many of them meaningless‚Ä¶but I <a href="https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/">could do it potentially</a>. I am basically talking into the void. But I put it in my mail signature, and spread the word. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/17/science-blog-wellcome-trust-writing-prize">Read this to be a successful blogger</a></p>

<p><em>Combination twitter/blog?</em></p>

<p>Totally, see <a href="https://moutreach.science/2020/11/12/LCA-this-pseudo-science.html">last post</a>.</p>

<h1 id="now-we-publish-a-blog-post-live">Now we publish a blog post live!</h1>

<p>We include examples of what the participants to this webinar do:</p>

<h4 id="example-allan-and-the-competitive-firms">Example: Allan and the competitive firms</h4>

<p><a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/103451">Allan</a>‚Äôs research explores and explains <strong>what drives competitiveness of firms</strong>. He looks at this within a number of contexts, which are defined by research questions such as: What are dynamic capabilities of firms? How to co-evolve dynamic capabilities with the value chains and ecosystems that firms are part of? How is this co-evolution shaped by the deep change involved in industry 4.0? What are the roles of strategy and innovation in the co-evolution in terms of developing organisational resilience? How is resilience translated into organisational structures and behaviour?
He applies mixed methods with an emphasis on how qualitative case studies and quantitative surveys are mutually supportive in creating scholarly knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="example-cumhur-on-differentiable-everything">Example: Cumhur on differentiable everything</h4>

<p>Cumhur‚Äôs research aims to understand how new advances in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming">differentiable  programming</a> can generate rich, interactive, synthetic audio-visual media that can be applied to sound, music, and movement computing.</p>

<p>This area of research uses and combines knowledge in  digital signal processing, convolutional neural networks, deep learning, and <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a> among others. Check <a href="http://cerkut.blog.aau.dk/">Cumhur‚Äôs blog</a> to learn more about these things.</p>

<p>¬†</p>

<h1 id="and-now-we-tweet-about-it">And now we tweet about it!</h1>

<p>‚ÄúI am presenting RIGHT NOW about my blog at a science communication seminar organised by @RJurowetzki. This is the blog post with the outline of my presentation. #Scicomm @aautech <a href="">link here</a>‚Äù</p>

<p>¬†</p>

<h1 id="meta-twittering">Meta-twittering</h1>

<p><em>Twitter is great, why?</em></p>

<p><strong>Follow scientists</strong>, learn a lot, learn before others. Get informed, scientists are communicating their own work - and those of others! Who better than them? Directly from the source not from journalists that ‚Äútranslate it‚Äù. Do /read fun stuff and silly sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Am I good at this?</em></p>

<p><strong>No it‚Äôs really hard</strong>. I even took a course organised by colleagues with <a href="https://twitter.com/WhySharksMatter">David Shieffman</a> Looked some videos (<a href="https://twitter-kursus.dk/kursus/">recent one I got from the uni is great</a>), in danish though. You can have tons of citations and still be very bad at attracting followers, and <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0424-0">viceversa</a> (‚Ä¶you can check your Kardashian Index <a href="https://theinformationalturn.net/kardashian-index/">here</a>).</p>

<p><em>What do I post there?</em></p>

<p>Twitter is <strong>micro-blogging</strong> so the short sotries that are well, too short to be in my own blog. Even if sometimes they become so long and relevant to be collected into a blog (See <a href="https://moutreach.science/2020/11/12/LCA-this-pseudo-science.html">example</a>). Then mostly <strong>engage &amp; discuss</strong>. Although, I am not too good at discussions on the internet, I am anxious, then I don‚Äôt sleep. But I can‚Äôt help. Another <strong>bad side</strong> is that you waste a lot of time.</p>

<p><em>Why not LinkedIn?</em></p>

<p>Disclaimer needed at this point: I think social media are here to <strong>exploit us</strong> and all of this should be taken with great care. Twitter leaves me - for now - with a good trade-off between the value I get from it and the anxiety/time wastage it brings me.</p>

<p>Specifically regarding LinkedIn, to be honest it has always bothered me, on LinkedIn people (me included) are simply there to show-off, and there are my friends from high-school, etc. Instead, <strong>Twitter is data</strong>, information, contacts, at global scale. However, if you are looking for exposure then LinkedIn can be good too, for example, same post two weeks ago got 268 views on Twitter, 2193 on LinkedIn. Note: I never, never, never blog on LinkedIn, why should I give these guys my content for free? BTW I am already giving a lot of it away on Twitter‚Ä¶see next point.</p>

<p><em>What tweets?</em></p>

<p>Twitter <strong>threads</strong> on topics of interest e.g. this on carbon offsetting:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have serious doubts about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/carbonoffsetting?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#carbonoffsetting</a>. Here a summary some sci papers I found that are critical too (alert: long thread!) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP25?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#COP25</a> inspired. Open for comments / feedback</p>&mdash; Massimo Pizzol (@m_outreach) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_outreach/status/1202840493148823554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Or this about a paper (well my PhD student did that, I just quoted).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/_SusanneK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@_SusanneK</a> explains our last paper on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blockchain</a> for food supply chains where she &quot;exploded&quot; üí• blockchain-based techs into different components and their links to other techsüëç and tried to understand what positive impact they bringüëáüëáüëá check it out <a href="https://t.co/wY12lElcGe">https://t.co/wY12lElcGe</a></p>&mdash; Massimo Pizzol (@m_outreach) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_outreach/status/1276436428973539328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I have shared with  students and colleagues when they need this, so <strong>very handy</strong>! Share stuff and retweet whatever of interest. Retweet not necessarily endorsement, see this for example on Vatican divesting:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I almost can&#39;t *believe* it but I am sharing vatican news. Apparently, &quot;da Vatican&quot; divests. The question <br />now is...where are they re-investing, what kind of impact-projects are they choosing, by which criteria? üßê <a href="https://t.co/OELQfo52fV">https://t.co/OELQfo52fV</a></p>&mdash; Massimo Pizzol (@m_outreach) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_outreach/status/1328620664341803009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><strong>Topics</strong>: sustainability, climate, LCA, modelling, and ‚Äúmeta‚Äù on research, sometimes politics. NO COVID! No personal stuff (kids, dogs). Too many GIFs maybe? I am maybe a bit noisy.</p>

<p>No real <strong>strategy</strong>. This is maybe why I have no followers‚Ä¶I have no time for this really, it becomes too much. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/jacomyma">Mathieu Jacomi</a> says in the first webinar, I don‚Äôt understand what works and not works on twitter. It‚Äôs like that. What tweets get a lot of impressions and why? Who knows.</p>
