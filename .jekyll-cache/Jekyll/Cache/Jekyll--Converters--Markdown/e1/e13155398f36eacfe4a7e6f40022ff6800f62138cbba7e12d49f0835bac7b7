<h1 id="timeline">Timeline</h1>

<p>This post is about the evolution of the <em>Holistic Design</em> course that I have been teching at SDU in Esbjerg in the last five years. Since I ‚Äúinherited‚Äù this course I don‚Äôt know where the name <em>Holistic Design</em> comes from and I didn‚Äôt get many indications at that time, but I was given quite some freedom in choosing the topics - as long as it was around LCA and within the hours available.</p>

<h1 id="2017">2017</h1>

<p><strong>Early days</strong>. I didn‚Äôt start completely from scratch, but I buildt this course relying on a previous bachelor LCA course also taught at SDU-Esbjerg and other bachelor and master courses in LCA and sustainability at AAU. In the same year I also developed a new course on LCA and ecodesign at AAU together with my colleague <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/100083">Henrik Riisgaard</a>, that was influenced by this.</p>

<p>The course was originally structured in six lectures:</p>

    <tr>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Product systems</em>: Introduction to LCA, focus on inventory: functional units, produc systems, computational structure with matrix algebra</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Consequential LCA</em>: Again life cycle inventory, focus on multifunctional activities and constrained suppliers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Indicators</em>: basically Life Cycle Impact Assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Input-Output analysis and case studies</em>: touching on IOA, doing <a href="https://moutreach.science/2017/06/30/Group-exercises-LCA-modelling.html">this exercise</a> on personal consumption patterns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For each lecture, a different <strong>group exercise</strong>. All exercises collected together in a <strong>portfolio</strong>. Portfolio starting point for the <strong>individual</strong> oral exam.</p>

<h1 id="2018">2018</h1>

<p>Several <strong>changes in structure</strong> based on the feedbacks from the students and what I thought was not working well or was too abstract or irrelevant.</p>

<p>New structure: <em>Systems thinking, Ecodesign workshop, Product systems I (Functional units, inventories and multifunctionality), Product Systems II (LCA dabases and software), Indicators (LCIA), Planetary boundaries and circular economy, Scenario workshop.</em></p>

<p>The lecture on planetary boundaries and circular economy was intended to introduce these concepts and link them to system thiking and to LCA, but also looking <strong>critically</strong> at them via exercises about the analysis of sources with pro/contra stances. The scenario workshop was about a compressed version of the participatory scenario development <a href="https://moutreach.science/2017/03/13/Group-exercises-participatory-scenario-development.html">exercise</a>.</p>

<h1 id="2019">2019</h1>

<p><strong>Less is more</strong>. Again changes compared to previous year, mainly cutting to make more space for core elements. I removed the ecodesign workshop (Henrik could not join), spread the LCA content in more lectures, added a buffer lecture for finishing exercises (students were always delayed with them), and included the SDGs in the last lecture.</p>

<p>New structure: <em>Systems thinking, Product systems I (qualitative, FU and flow chart), Product Systems II (quantiative: matrices for inventories and multifunctionality), LCA dabases and software, Indicators (LCIA), Planetary boundaries circular economy and SDGs.</em></p>

<h1 id="2020">2020</h1>

<p>The course started basically simultaneously with the COVID <strong>pandemic</strong>. No time to prepare for the sudden shift to remote teaching so the same program was maintained with minor modifications, and the main change was that all lectures were given online. Using Zoom for presentations and discussions in plenum and Slack for chatting and posting material and notes.</p>

<p>After a couple of lectures I realized I could record them and upload them for the students to see them again. I started learning about <strong>using vidoes</strong> and the potential of videos.</p>

<p>Overall, not the best settings and constant emergency mode, but we managed.</p>

<p>That year I skipped the module on <em>scenario workshop</em>. Not possible remotely, but in all honesty it didn‚Äôt work well live either, there was not enough time for it even if compressed (shuold be done in two days). We instead used the extra time for more Q&amp;A and group exercises, since doing things online we were overall delayed.</p>

<h1 id="2021">2021</h1>

<p>Still pandemic, still teaching online. I had realized early on in 2020 that ‚Äúdoing the same things as before but in zoom‚Äù was a terrible approach to teaching. So I switched to <strong>flipped-classroom</strong> mode. I recorded some videos and provided the materials to students in advance on the course platform. Then spent the online class time on Q&amp;A on the material and supervision of group exercises, jumping from one Zoom breakout room to the other. It worked better than previous year.</p>

<p>In this year I also included a module on critical assessment of models, inspired by the work of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901119304721">Funtowic</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01812-9">Saltelli</a> &amp; co. In particular I developed this exercise:</p>

I have designed and tested this exercise with my students today as a conclusion lecture of a course on sustainability. Based on <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreaSaltelli?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AndreaSaltelli</a> et al. manifesto. <br /><br />Great success! <a href="https://t.co/ilIqTIMa17">pic.twitter.com/ilIqTIMa17</a></p>&mdash; Massimo Pizzol ‚òÆüá∫üá¶ (@m_outreach) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_outreach/status/1374737417362681859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2021</a></blockquote>

<h1 id="2022">2022</h1>

<p>Back to teaching <strong>in person</strong>. Full flipped-classroom mode: all the videos made during the pandemic provided in advance, together with readings. At the classes, the structure is always Q&amp;A on the material, and supervision of group exercises (in person). Worked very well, probably the best version of the course I ever made. I strnghtened also the focus on the critical assessment of models, and model lmitations, proposing again exercises like this.</p>

<p>At the end of the course the assignments were very high quality, full LCAs and very reflective students.</p>

<h1 id="stop-when-you-are-on-top">Stop when you are on top</h1>

<p>After five years, I feel this course has been perfectioned to a very high degree. In the last editions I really enjoyed the discussion and the overall process. Why stopping now? Got a large project that will keep me occupied next years and the course is at another university than mine (they collaborate) so I need to reduce and focus on the in-house teaching.</p>

<p>The point of this post is: <strong>it takes time</strong> to make a good course.</p>

<p>Also, a big <strong>thank you</strong> to all the students, I hope the course as as useful and enojyable to you as it was to me.</p>
