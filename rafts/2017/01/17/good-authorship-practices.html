<p> </p>

<p>Writing scientific papers is hard. Dealing with co-authorship issues is harder.</p>

<p>Here below I wrote a bullet-point list of what I believe are good co-authorship practices.</p>

<p><strong>These are lessons learnt from problems I run into or mistakes I did.</strong></p>

<p>I wrote them here as a reminder to myself. If they are useful for you too, well…good.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>Always remember that…</em></p>

<p>1) <strong>Nobody</strong>, no matter his/her position, is entitled to be co-author by default</p>

<p>2) <strong>Only</strong> substantial contributions lead to co-authorship</p>

<p>3) <strong>The first author</strong> is in the best position to evaluate which contributions were substantial</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>A paper is a project and thus requires project management…</em></p>

<p>4) Deal with authorship issues <strong>openly and transparently</strong>. Bring them up for discussion instead of avoiding them. They will pop out anyway.</p>

<p>5) Discuss authorship before doing the research/experiments, and <strong>always before you start writing</strong> the paper. This means also clarifying with potential co-authors mutual expectations from the beginning.</p>

<p>6) Make a research plan and a <strong>writing plan</strong> with realistic milestones and concrete tasks. It allows keeping track of contributions. It is then easy to look back and check who did/delivered what and when in case of controversies.</p>

<p>7) Use the <strong>Acknowledgements</strong> section. Those who helped by reading a draft and giving comments, advices, and opinions are not co-authors, but deserve a formal “thank you” in the Acknowledgements (note: always ask the person before doing it).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>Bonus, number eight…</em></p>

<p>8) In an <em>ideal</em> world, the previous points would be enough. Yet co-authorship is a <strong>sensible topic</strong>. Sometimes troubles are inevitable and somebody gets pissed off. Seek the advice of a senior colleague or peer in case of serious problems. Reading the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf">Vancouver reccomendations</a> can be of concrete help too.</p>
