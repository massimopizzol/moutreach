<p>Now it’s time to gradually upload content…so let’s start breaking the ice. <strong>The first feeling of being online is a mix of excitement and fear</strong>.</p>

<p>Excitement for having succeeded with the practical implementation. I am so happy to be using Jekyll to put this blog together. I have taken the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">minima</a> theme and modified only a bit, can’t do more with my current skills, but honestly I am not interested in graphic layout too much anyway. It has been a steep learning curve since I am not a web programmer at all (didn’t even know what html was before starting…). Almost a DYI project. However, <strong>great satisfaction and feeling of ownership</strong> now that everything is settled into place!</p>

<p>Excitement because this space opens for a lot of <strong>new communication and dissemination possibilities</strong> compared to my current academic outreach. I felt for a long time the need to bring my work to the attention of a larger public. I don’t think it makes sense to keep it confined to the academic audience. Not because what I do is more important or deserves more attention than what others’ do. It is more like a (<em>moral?</em>) obligation. Bringing the research results to the public, and making the effort to communicate them in comprehensible ways…I think is part of my job. As simple as that. Also, this is a space to present views I have on general research topics (peer-review, authorships, etc.), and teaching that I can’t publish elsewhere. Hopefully I’ll get feedback to initiate some discussions.</p>

<p>Fear because I hope to live up to the blogging task…so far so good though, fingers crossed and looking forward to the rest.</p>
