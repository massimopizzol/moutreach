I remember when my supervisor told me _"Do you want to go abroad during your PhD? But...you are *already* abroad!?!"_ 

We were discussing me spending some time doing research at a foreign institution during the PhD project. In his mind, since I had moved from Italy to Denmark for this project, I didn't need to go anywhere else...

But, that argument didn't really prevent me to pack my stuff and spend three months kindly hosted by Cecile Bulle & the LCA group of [CIRAIG](http://www.ciraig.org/en/). During the freaking peak of the Canadian winter. 

But I like winter! __They don't make it anymore__ in these days of global warming, and anyway according to the locals that was a very warm one, only minus 27 degrees Celsius. 

That was ten years ago and yes, this is a nostalgic blog post about research stays abroad.

It is partly inspired by the recent visit of my former host in Montreal, and former CIRAIG PhD student, now _Professeur agrÃ©gÃ©_, Dr. Ing. Ph.D. [Ben Amor](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/gcivil/departement/corps-professoral/mourad-ben-amor/) who has joined our LCA group in Aalborg for about a week. 

Check [the twitter thread of his guest lecture](https://twitter.com/m_outreach/status/1225692523319853057?s=20) showing off some of his recent LCA projects at the [LIRIDE](https://www.liride.info/?lang=en) lab.

# Get out

There is a sort of unwritten rule - or perhaps it is actually written somewhere, but I haven't checked - in Danish academia that PhD students should spend a __period abroad__ during their three-year project. 

The purpose is twofold: strengthen their research network and experience a different research environment than the one they are used to. Because, well, there is __not only one way__ of doing research and one might actually learn something from others...

Recently I had the chance to discuss __how to find a good place__ for a research stay. These are my recommendations. I'll use some very random names for some of the following examples. 

- __Complementarity__. One option is to find a place where you can get something that your university and supervisor does not provide. Knowledge, data, models. For example, you know that prof. W. White at University X is __working with a new method__ that you don't know how to use but you think it would be really great for your next paper. Or, you have developed an amazing new model and want to try it out on a specific problem, and you don't have the data, but prof. W. White has collected them. Get in touch with [Walter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Walter_White2.jpg), sorry I mean with dr. White, and propose him to work on a joint study at his lab. This is a particularly good option if your research is interdisciplinary.

- __Synergy__. Another option is to find a research group that does similar things as your home group. You have been working on topic X and you know that [Flint C. et al.](https://black-sails.fandom.com/wiki/James_Flint?file=Flint_648x1080.jpg) have been working on X too overseas, and there is the chance to join forces and do __something revolutionary__ on X. Get in touch with Flint and his crew to get this collaboration sailing. This is a good option if you plan to stay in your current field of research in the future and want to start or build a long-term collaboration between groups. And who knows, perhaps it could be a good place for your postdoc? 

- __Homework__.Check throughly the profiles of those you are going to collaborate with. Do they have a good publication record? And does their publication record matches the expertise that you are looking for? Then I must say, although it is tempting to be hosted by the famous Professor White or Flint, these guys are often really __busy__ with their own projects. So another thing to check is whether the hosting person/group will actually have the time to follow you during the stay. A preliminary talk about mutual expectations regarding supervision can help in this sense - and I would warmly recommend it before agreeing on the collaboration. Make sure your supervisor is also oriented about the whole thing...

- __Win-win__. What's White's share? What's in it for Flint? People kindly hosting a PhD at their premises let the student use their data, models, machinery, etc. Provide office space, do paperwork to ensure visa, lab access, software licences, etc. And provide supervision. __This is work__. Free work most of the times. They should probably get something in return and the classic way of doing this is to work on a co-authored publication as output. 


# Get in

I also receive often requests from PhD students to join our group for a period and work on specific LCA topic, for example [consequential LCA](https://consequential-lca.org/). Over time, I have elaborated my personal three 'rules' to host PhD students.

1. We work on a topic of __common interest__. For example, on a topic that I find interesting but I haven't had the chance to work on yet, or something I have tried in the past but would like to do more of. Or something I am working on -just right now- and can be expanded in some way or direction.

2. The duration of the stay is __minimum three months__. One does not get enough work done in less than this - with me at least. Ideally, the PhD student does some preliminary work before arriving (e.g. collect and organise relevant data), then during the period spent at our premises the students focuses on setting up a model and analysing results, and once returned home we collaborate remotely on the draft of a paper until submission. Three months is a good minimum also in order to get to know the people at our premises and the country etc. I mean, there is life beyond work...

3. The outcome of the collaboration is to write, __together__, a __co-authored paper__. However, this must **not** be the first paper that the PhD student writes in his/her life. Writing the first paper is generally very though for PhD students, and requires substantial supervision and feedback. I believe the main supervisor should be the one taking care of this, not me.

Here could be the good place to write something slightly stereotypical like _As a good Italian I am quite flexible about rules..._, which is actually not completely wrong, but the truth is that I am flexible about many things in terms of hosting people, but breaking the 'rules' above becomes very counterproductive for me, so I try to stick to them. 

We can also call them __best practices__ and _voilÃ¡_, problem solved.


# Get somewhere

Due to practical reasons like lack of office space and time it is not always possible to host PhD students. Sometimes collaborations are extremely fruitful, some other times they don't work as well as one would expect. 

In my experience, it __typically__ works well and ends up in a joint publication, so spending time abroad during the PhD period is something I strongly recommend - of course assuming one's resources allow for it.

Yet, even if one doesn't actually get this damn paper published, the time spent within another research environment can be a good basis for critical reflections on how research is done in another context compared to the context one is familiar with, which is a valuable insight and learning to bring home __anyway__. 

As valuable as a __barrel of dollars__ or a __chest of gold__.
