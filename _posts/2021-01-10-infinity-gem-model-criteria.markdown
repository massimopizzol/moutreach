# We knew it before it was cool

Back in the mid nineties when I was collecting Marvel comics there was only me and my classmate to know who was Thanos, Silver Surfer, Adam Warlock, and of course the infinity stones (translated in infinity _gems_ in Italian, we didn't get original English language comics back then, we barely knew how to read English actually). We were the real nerds and we didn't know it, because we didn't know what a nerd was. We knew this was cool stuff, but nobody seemed to have a clue about it.

Nowadays everybody has seen some Marvel blockbuster movies and all the kids know who Thanos is, and Captain America, and bla bla bla, and Marvel changed the colours of the infinity stones, and the story is all different and who knows how Jim Starling is feeling about this. I feel betrayed, hollywood has taken my teenage world and made it commercial [^1]. Damn.

But anyway, I made this all introduction about comics to say two things. First: I knew this stuff was cool before it actually become cool. So maybe - who knows - I also have this intuition about scientific papers? I mean, if I can do it with comics then it's piece of cake with papers, I have read just as many... And since it's the end of the year and it's time to make lists, you'll get a top-ten but instead of a top-ten is a Marvel-inspired **top-gem**. 

What is a top-gem? Instead of listing the best ten papers I read in 2020, I will list the best papers in six infinity stones categories: power, soul, mind, time, space, reality. 
So you can say to your PhD-titled friends: YOU READ IT HERE FIRST!

[^1]: And more! Series like TBBT have made it cool to be a nerd - but how many of the people watching these episodes have actually played one single session of D&D? I did, and in the basement as it should be.
