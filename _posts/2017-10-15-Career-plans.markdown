# How do you see yourself in five years?

_Driving a nice car with a hot girlfriend._ Answered a friend of mine at an interview. He got the job. At a car leasing company.

These days I think a lot about this question. I wonder about my future career plans.

Maybe I read too much bullshit on LinkedIn. Why are all these awful _how to survive interviews_ click-bait posts popping-up in my feed? Maybe it's because I am writing a series of project applications with a long time frame, where I have to elaborate on the long-term **impact** of the project on my career development. Like the project was a meteorite.

Anyway, I am asking myself quite often the question of _how do I see myself...?_ And I have **three dystopian scenarios** for that.

# Nobel Prize Or Nothing (NOPE) scenario

It's good to set ambitious objectives. It's also good to understand when it's time to quit. Probably, if in ten years from now I haven't got any major grant, nor I have produced any real scientific breakthrough, or at least some paper with tons of citation or a major role in a collaborative international project, then...what the heck am I still doing at University? Ok **easy now**. This is the scenario about insecurity, when you feel like you are not good enough if you are not overachieving. This is especially the feeling when I write project applications and have to polish and boost my CV and the project impact description, etc. So much self-promotion that it becomes toxic. Or when I spend too much time on social media and there everybody seems so great. It's virtual reality.

# Back to REalITy (BRExIT) scenario

This is the scenario about exit strategies.

1. I changed field of research and I am now working in something that is not [postnormal science](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001632879390022L?via%3Dihub), just normal science. Gosh I really hope for this every single day.
2. I went into consultancy or corporate, maybe I have recycled myself in a data analyst or management position. The former is fun now, but maybe boring in 10 years. The latter is boring now, but maybe fun in 10 years. Who knows.
2. I moved to work for government or NGOs and I am now making a **real** difference to help the environment and other people. That would be really a good thing.

The reason for this scenario is that sometimes I find it hard to see the true societal value of my research, beyond the academic value. Who cares about _uncertainties in consequential life cycle inventories_? Is this research going to change the world? Is this going to change anything at all? Is anybody interested in this besides 5-10 academics? It's worth asking these questions. Academic work is prestigious, but is it valuable? A colleague of mine quit industrial ecology and started a new education to become a nurse. Maybe she has understood something I haven't understood yet?

# Business As Usual And Bored (BAUAB) scenario

What if I will just get things get by as good as usual? I think it would be pretty feasible to get along at University by doing the required teaching and publishing the required papers every year[^1]. This is also the scenario where I think about people who stayed in **academia for a lifetime**. Will I be able to do something like that? These were other generations. Things are not as stable anymore, and I since I mostly had temporary positions so far I can hardly imagine something like that in detail.

What if I become disillusioned with my field of research, or research in general, or lose faith in humanity? I am quite close to that some days. If people can spend a billion dollar budget for a crappy Hollywood movie instead of environmental protection there is not much to hope for.


# Let's talk about feelings[^2]

No surprises, probably the truth is in the middle. The future will be a mix of the three scenarios. Some things will be successful, some will be abandoned along the way, some will get boring. In the end, this is a post to talk about **feelings in research**: insecurity, competition, meaning, relevance, interest, ambition, grit, motivation...and the lack of these. They all play a role as in any other job, I guess. I haven't tried many other jobs. That's why I have a research blog.

A buddhist monk would probably tell me: _focus on the present_. That's quite right. Focus on doing NOW some research that is of **high quality**, has **societal relevance and impact**, and is **intellectually stimulating**. If these conditions are satisfied, there shall be no need for any of the above scenarios.
