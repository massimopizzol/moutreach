# Intro


Short recap of the recent scandal about the Dnaish ministry of transport resigning after hiding LCA data on the impact of infrastructure. 

Firtly, the entire investigation is reported by the newspaper Ingenioren here, excellent work and reconstruction of the events based on the mails from the minister and collaborators. 

In a nutshell, the government proposes a new infrastructure plan where main focus is on building  new motorways and little on public transport and cycling. The plan is sold as "carbon neutral" which brings mich debate: how can motorways be carbon neutral? They can't of course.

Turns out the impact of the plan, for the motorway part, is estimated using a LCA model developed by Danish consultancy. 

Problem is, the results of the LCA model show that the impact of the infrastructure (building the actual motorway) is a major hotspot (orders of magnitude higer than the imapct from use stage). 

ingeniÃ¸ren reconstructs how these data have been progressively been removed in the varios steps form when the modelling is done, reported, and finally presented to the parlamient for a vote. 

One for the reasons for excluding the infrastructure carbon impact is that these estimates were considered too uncertain.

Another reason is that the impact of infrastructure was __already__ accounted in the climate plans up to 2030. And since these plans show that DK will be carbon netural by that time, including the impact in the mobility plan again would be double counting. 

Disregarding the faulty logic that a reduction in impact is always needed, how can the plan be carbon neutral? Because it assuems that, in some years form now, some magic technology will allow us to such carbon from the atmosphere or compensate for emsission with storage, the famously called "hockey-stick". I.e. relying on future abatement technology that is not here yete, a risky strategy.

Anyway, since the minister didn't provide the CO2 numbers when asked by other coalition and opposition parties, and these numbers instead exist a the ingeniorn shows, then the minister lost the trust and had to resign.
