&nbsp;

Writing scientific papers is hard. Dealing with co-authorship issues is harder.

Here below I wrote a bullet-point list of what I believe are good co-authorship practices.

**These are lessons learnt from problems I run into or mistakes I did.**

I wrote them here as a reminder to myself. If they are useful for you too, well...good.

&nbsp;

_Always remember that..._

1) **Nobody**, no matter his/her position, is entitled to be co-author by default

2) **Only** substantial contributions lead to co-authorship

3) **The first author** is in the best position to evaluate which contributions were substantial

&nbsp;

_A paper is a project and thus requires project management..._

4) Deal with authorship issues **openly and transparently**. Bring them up for discussion instead of avoiding them. They will pop out anyway.

5) Discuss authorship before doing the research/experiments, and **always before you start writing** the paper. This means also clarifying with potential co-authors mutual expectations from the beginning.

6) Make a research plan and a **writing plan** with realistic milestones and concrete tasks. It allows keeping track of contributions. It is then easy to look back and check who did/delivered what and when in case of controversies.

7) Use the **Acknowledgements** section. Those who helped by reading a draft and giving comments, advices, and opinions are not co-authors, but deserve a formal "thank you" in the Acknowledgements (note: always ask the person before doing it).

&nbsp;

_Bonus, number eight..._

8) In an _ideal_ world, the previous points would be enough. Yet co-authorship is a **sensible topic**. Sometimes troubles are inevitable and somebody gets pissed off. Seek the advice of a senior colleague or peer in case of serious problems. Reading the [Vancouver reccomendations](http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf) can be of concrete help too.
