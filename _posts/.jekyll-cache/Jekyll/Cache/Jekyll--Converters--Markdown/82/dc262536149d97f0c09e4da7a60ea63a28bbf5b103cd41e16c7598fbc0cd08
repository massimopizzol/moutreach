<h1 id="how-do-you-see-yourself-in-five-years">How do you see yourself in five years?</h1>

<p><em>Driving a nice car with a hot girlfriend.</em> Answered a friend of mine at an interview. He got the job. At a car leasing company.</p>

<p>These days I think a lot about this question. I wonder about my future career plans.</p>

<p>Maybe I read too much bullshit on LinkedIn. Why are all these awful <em>how to survive interviews</em> click-bait posts popping-up in my feed? Maybe it’s because I am writing a series of project applications with a long time frame, where I have to elaborate on the long-term <strong>impact</strong> of the project on my career development. Like the project was a meteorite.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am asking myself quite often the question of <em>how do I see myself…?</em> And I have <strong>three dystopian scenarios</strong> for that.</p>

<h1 id="nobel-prize-or-nothing-nope-scenario">Nobel Prize Or Nothing (NOPE) scenario</h1>

<p>It’s good to set ambitious objectives. It’s also good to understand when it’s time to quit. Probably, if in ten years from now I haven’t got any major grant, nor I have produced any real scientific breakthrough, or at least some paper with tons of citation or a major role in a collaborative international project, then…what the heck am I still doing at University? Ok <strong>easy now</strong>. This is the scenario about insecurity, when you feel like you are not good enough if you are not overachieving. This is especially the feeling when I write project applications and have to polish and boost my CV and the project impact description, etc. So much self-promotion that it becomes toxic. Or when I spend too much time on social media and there everybody seems so great. It’s virtual reality.</p>

<h1 id="back-to-reality-brexit-scenario">Back to REalITy (BRExIT) scenario</h1>

<p>This is the scenario about exit strategies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I changed field of research and I am now working in something that is not <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001632879390022L?via%3Dihub">postnormal science</a>, just normal science. Gosh I really hope for this every single day.</li>
  <li>I went into consultancy or corporate, maybe I have recycled myself in a data analyst or management position. The former is fun now, but maybe boring in 10 years. The latter is boring now, but maybe fun in 10 years. Who knows.</li>
  <li>I moved to work for government or NGOs and I am now making a <strong>real</strong> difference to help the environment and other people. That would be really a good thing.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason for this scenario is that sometimes I find it hard to see the true societal value of my research, beyond the academic value. Who cares about <em>uncertainties in consequential life cycle inventories</em>? Is this research going to change the world? Is this going to change anything at all? Is anybody interested in this besides 5-10 academics? It’s worth asking these questions. Academic work is prestigious, but is it valuable? A colleague of mine quit industrial ecology and started a new education to become a nurse. Maybe she has understood something I haven’t understood yet?</p>

<h1 id="business-as-usual-and-bored-bauab-scenario">Business As Usual And Bored (BAUAB) scenario</h1>

<p>What if I will just get things get by as good as usual? I think it would be pretty feasible to get along at University by doing the required teaching and publishing the required papers every year<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This is also the scenario where I think about people who stayed in <strong>academia for a lifetime</strong>. Will I be able to do something like that? These were other generations. Things are not as stable anymore, and I since I mostly had temporary positions so far I can hardly imagine something like that in detail.</p>

<p>What if I become disillusioned with my field of research, or research in general, or lose faith in humanity? I am quite close to that some days. If people can spend a billion dollar budget for a crappy Hollywood movie instead of environmental protection there is not much to hope for.</p>

<h1 id="lets-talk-about-feelings">Let’s talk about feelings<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h1>

<p>No surprises, probably the truth is in the middle. The future will be a mix of the three scenarios. Some things will be successful, some will be abandoned along the way, some will get boring. In the end, this is a post to talk about <strong>feelings in research</strong>: insecurity, competition, meaning, relevance, interest, ambition, grit, motivation…and the lack of these. They all play a role as in any other job, I guess. I haven’t tried many other jobs. That’s why I have a research blog.</p>

<p>A buddhist monk would probably tell me: <em>focus on the present</em>. That’s quite right. Focus on doing NOW some research that is of <strong>high quality</strong>, has <strong>societal relevance and impact</strong>, and is <strong>intellectually stimulating</strong>. If these conditions are satisfied, there shall be no need for any of the above scenarios.</p>
