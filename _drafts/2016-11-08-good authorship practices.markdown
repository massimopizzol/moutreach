...which are also lessons learnt from mistakes I did.

### Always keep in mind that...

* **Nobody**, no matter his/her position, is entitled to be co-author by default
* **Only** substantial contributions lead to co-authorship
* **The first author** is in the best position to evaluate which contributions were substantial

### I also recommend...

* Dealing with authorship issues **openly and transparently**. Bringing them up for discussion instead of avoiding them. They will pop out anyway.
* Discussing authorship before doing the research/experiments, and **always** before you start writing the paper. This means also clarifying with potential co-authors mutual expectations and expected contributions from the beginning.
* Having a **writing plan** with realistic milestones, e.g. *Day X first author sends draft to co-authors*, *Day X + 15 all comments from co-authors received* and concrete tasks, e.g. *Person X please read and comment on section Y*, *Person Y please answer to reviewer comment #X*.
* Using the **Acknowledgements** section. Probably somebody helped by e.g. reading a draft and giving comments, advices, and opinions. This is not enough for co-authorship, but deservers a formal thank you in the Acknowledgements (note: always ask before doing it).

### Bonus! Number eight...
* Authorship is a **sensible topic**. Sometimes troubles are inevitable and somebody gets pissed off. Seeking the advice of a senior colleague or peer in case of serious troubles is highly recommend.
