They really do.

Gift authorship is when a person is included in the list of authors of a scientific article not because of an actual substantial contribution, but because of other reasons unrelated to the research. Basically, it means giving credit to someone who doesn't deserve it.

There are various cases of gift authorship I know of. A frequent one is _**the enslaved**_. This is typically a PhD student who, more or less explicitly, is forced to include the supervisor(s) in the list. In the supervisor-student relationship the latter is clearly the one in the subordinate position, in terms of power. This makes the all thing particularly unjust. Then there is _**the zealous**_. This is a junior researcher including a senior colleague to get visibility or favor or because of some unwritten crazy department tradition. A sort of [_jus primae noctis_][7] of modern science. Another case is _**the buffet**_, when a research group leader includes all collaborators just because they are more or less officially in the group. The effect is a "dilution" of the merit and a disproportionately long lists of authors...Last but not least _**the purchaser**_ type i.e. the person who feels entitled to co-authorship because funded the project or "got the grant", even though he/she didn't contribute to the research activities at all. Essentially somebody buying reputation.

Personally I find gift authorships both unprofessional and unethical, thus unacceptable. This is also the position of [Yale Univerity][1], [Harvard UNiversity][2], the [Council of Science Editors][3], [etc.][4]. Most scientific journals warn against this practice in their guidelines for authors too, obviously, but somehow the message has not been received fully as the problem keeps persisting. To a degree, I can understand why 20 years ago this issue may have just been ignored or treated as a marginal problem. Research is not the same as 20 years ago though. Competition is fiercer and there is much more focus on quantitative indicators of scientific performance: number of peer-reviewer contributions published, number of  citations, H-indexes... Since there is no difference between first and last author in these statistics, then gift authorships basically distort the performance measurements. They inflate the stats of those who receive the gift.

Gift authorships is particularly damaging for young researchers. As I mentioned above these are in a vulnerable position because are imposed this practice from senior colleagues or leaders. They can rebel of course but this may signify bad working relationships for the oncoming years. Who wants that? Moreover, gift authorships impede young researchers showing independence. This is important when noting that a selection criteria of some starting grants (e.g. ERC) is that the applicant has published without the supervisor. So gift authorship is not only unacceptable, but also deleterious.

Why are many research environments still allowing gift authorships is a mistery to me. Note that this is a grey practice, so officially everybody is against it but unofficially it is tolerated, or at least not actively investigated or punished. Just read the stories on the comments sections of this blog post by [COPE][5]. If you are in one of the situations above, you must get out of it, you are damaging yours and others' career. Check out this great [flowchart][6] on what to do if you suspect gift authorship.

Some personal thoughts on the cases mentioned above. If you feel gift authorship is being forced on you, you can bend your head, or bring up the problem (professionally, kindly and respectfully). Things may solve out, or may go very wrong, so be prepared. As PhD student or junior researcher you are in a disadvantaged position, but you are on the right side, read the guidelines I cited above. Don't be afraid of publishing alone, it will make you more independent and your research stronger. If you are part of a research group or leading it, then push for co-authorships based on a serious evaluation of substantial contributions. The person who got the funding gets other benefits from the management, so requests of automatic co-authorship are out of place. There is a long way between saying one'll do things, and actually doing things. Authorship is for the latter.

Three main things to keep in mind:

* **Nobody**, no matter his/her position, is entitled to be co-author by default
* **Only** substantial contributions lead to co-authorship
* **The first author** is in the best position to evaluate which contributions were substantial



Some good practices I feel to recommend, which are also lessons learnt from mistakes I did:

* Dealing with authorship issues openly and transparently. Bringing them up for discussion instead of avoiding them. They will pop out anyway.
* Discussing authorship before doing the research/experiments, and **always** before starting writing the paper. This means also clarifying with potential co-authors mutual expectations and expected contributions from the beginning.
* Having a writing-plan with 1) realistic milestones, e.g. *Day X main author sends draft to co-authors*, *Day X + 15 comments received from co-authors* and 2) concrete tasks for co-authors, e.g. *Person X please read and comment on section Y*, *Person Y please answer to reviewer comment #X*.
* Using the Acknowledgements section. Probably somebody helped by e.g. reading a draft and giving comments, advices, and opinions. This is not enough for co-authorship, but deservers a formal thank you in the Acknowledgements (note: always ask before doing it).
* Seeking the advice of a senior colleague or peer in case of serious troubles. Authorship is a sensible topic. There is always somebody who gets pissed off.
